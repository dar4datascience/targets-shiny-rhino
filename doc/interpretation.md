The density plots show the marginal posterior distribution of the [association parameter](https://mc-stan.org/rstanarm/articles/jm.html#association-structures) `alpha` of each of the univariate joint models. Each model uses the [current value association structure](https://mc-stan.org/rstanarm/articles/jm.html#association-structures), so `alpha` is the log fold change to the hazard rate of death for each unit increase of the biomarker. In other words, `alpha` is the increase in the log hazard of death per unit increase of the biomarker. `alpha` above 0 is evidence that the biomarker is positively associated with mortality.
