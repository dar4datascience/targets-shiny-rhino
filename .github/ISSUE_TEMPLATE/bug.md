## Prework

* [ ] Read and agree to the [code of conduct](https://contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.html) and [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/wlandau/targets-shiny/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
* [ ] Confirm that your issue is most likely a genuine bug in the `targets` package itself and not a user error or known limitation. For usage issues and troubleshooting, please post to the [discussions](https://github.com/wlandau/targets-shiny/discussions) instead.
* [ ] If there is [already a relevant issue](https://github.com/wlandau/targets-shiny/issues), whether open or closed, comment on the existing thread instead of posting a new issue.
* [ ] Post a [minimal reproducible example](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/) like [this one](https://github.com/wlandau/targets-shiny/issues/256#issuecomment-754229683) so the maintainer can troubleshoot the problems you identify. A reproducible example is:
    * [ ] **Runnable**: post enough R code and data so any onlooker can create the error on their own computer.
    * [ ] **Minimal**: reduce runtime wherever possible and remove complicated details that are irrelevant to the issue at hand.
    * [ ] **Readable**: format your code according to the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/).
